# pathbrute
Pathbrute  
  
Pathbrute is a DirB/Dirbuster type of tool designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers.  
However, it has some new tricks. It is no longer a dumb directories/files brute force tool if you use the -v and -i option.  
  
It runs on Windows/Linux/OSX operating systems and on ARM/ARM64/x86/x64 processors.  
    
Some of it includes:    
1) Wordlists from Exploit databases and Metasploit  
2) Identify interesting URLs eventhough websites return HTTP status code 200 for all URI paths.  
3) Identify valid  paths that require authentication (HTTP status code 401)  
4) Reduce the number of results for wordlists with URI paths with nested directories (See https://github.com/milo2012/pathbrute/issues/1 for more information)  
  
Pathbrute has a number of wordlists from metasploit/exploit-database and other sources that it uses to discover interesting content on servers.  
  
pathBrute contains/uses a number of self compiled wordlists for identifying “interesting” content and potentially vulnerable websites.
1) More than 18899 URI paths from Exploit-Database 
2) More than 442 URI paths from Metasploit Framework
3) More than 9745 URI paths from Packetstorm  
  
pathBrute can also use wordlists from other sources if you prefer.  
pathBrute can also be used for identifying if any type of CMS (Joomla, WordPress and Drupal) is running on the target websites and fingerprint the versions of the CMS using the –cms option.  
  
Binaries for different platforms and architectures are available in the the release section.  
 
**Please check RELEASE section for compiled executables**

### Explanation of the output from pathBrute  
```
https://208.88.199.241/sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/wdr_test_gantt [code:401] [458] [File or directory not found] [27736 of 38988]
```
Below is a description of the output from pathBrute  
  
**[401]** - refers to the HTTP status code  
**[458]** - refers to the size of the HTTP response  
**[File or directory not found]** - refers to the title of the page  
**[27736 of 38988]** - refers to the current position in the list   
         
***
    
### Example using the --cms option  
Below is a sample output when using the --cms option to fingerprint the CMS on the target hosts.  It also returns the Metasploit modules based on the version of the CMS software.  
 
```
$ /git/pathbrute/pathBrute -U urls.txt --cms -i -v
